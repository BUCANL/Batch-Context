# Batch Context
The Batch Context extension for EEGLAB provides an interface for generating data 
processing pipelines and executing them on multiple data files either locally or 
on remote clusters. This extension also provides the tools needed to manage 
remote server addresses and facilitates working in remote environments.

# Documentation
This plugin is part of BUCANL's [Lossless](https://github.com/BUCANL/BIDS-Lossless-EEG) EEG pipeline. As part of this, all tutorials and documentation are written using the Face13 dataset. Instructions on how to download and initialize this data can be found, [here](https://github.com/BUCANL/BIDS-Init-Face13-EEGLAB).

The reference manual for this plugin can be found on this repository's accompanying [wiki](https://github.com/BUCANL/Batch-Context/wiki) page.

A tutorial with examples using the Face13 data can be found, [here](https://bucanl.github.io/SDC-BATCH-CONTEXT/).
